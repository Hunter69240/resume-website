                    I’m a Computer Science student at Atria Institute of Technology with a strong interest in combining software with real-world hardware. I completed my schooling at Sri Sri Ravishankar Vidya Mandir, where I developed a solid academic foundation.
                    My projects range from AI-powered music generation using machine learning to Arduino-based prototypes for accessibility and automation. I’m currently sharpening my skills in frontend development with React, React Native, and Tailwind CSS, and I’ve also started exploring video editing using DaVinci Resolve.
                    Recently, I published a research paper that strengthened my ability to think critically and communicate technical ideas effectively. Outside of tech, I enjoy playing cricket and basketball, listening to music, and watching documentaries—all of which keep me balanced, active, and curious.
